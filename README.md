Too lazy to write this. But soon will do "_".

Setup `config.json`, `config.ini` and start with `node selfbot.js`.

You would probably need some modules, so go ahead and install them xD

Don't say, you don't like my code, I have not written it for you.

Btw, I did not upload any commands, but a zip with those commands, that I currently use.
You can use them yourself, or write your own.

Please be careful, because self-botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and can get you banned.
I am not responsible for you and your actions.
Of course, this source code can also be used for a normal bot.
(Only the status part won't work well)
